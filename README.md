# Next.js E-Commerce Site

This is a full-stack e-commerce site I'm building for my siblings, who wanted a place to sell their earrings and other jewelry items.

They originally wanted to use Etsy, but after hearing that they took a large percentage of their sale, I told them I'd make them a personalized site where the only fees are the card processing fees, which are much less than Etsy takes.
